# frontend

This is the frontend (client side) of my thesis project.
The website is called myMed, and the final version of the frontend was uploaded on Google Firebase.
The frontend was developed with React.

(Currently the server is down.)

The initial objective of this thesis is to develop a web application for doctors capable of
managing patients’ data. The management of patients’ data involves recording and processing
their health record, physical examination, diagnosis, and therapy.
